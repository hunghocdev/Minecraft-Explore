          <p>
            In the world of Minecraft, there are three main dimensions or
            "worlds" that players can explore, each with its own unique
            characteristics, resources, and challenges. These worlds include the
            Overworld, the Nether, and The End.

          <strong>The overworld</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="pic topic1">
          <img src="./pic/p2.jpg" alt="the overworldoverworld" />
        </div>
        <div class="content topic1"></div>
        <p>
          This is the starting world and is where players spend most of their
          time. The Overworld has the most diverse and familiar environment,
          similar to our real world, with different biomes such as plains,
          forests, deserts, mountains, and oceans.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Main Characteristics:</strong> It has a day and night cycle,
            changing weather, and is home to many peaceful animals (like cows,
            sheep, chickens) as well as hostile monsters that appear at night or
            in the dark (like Zombies, Creepers, Skeletons).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Resources:</strong> This is the only place to find essential
            resources like wood, stone, and most types of metal ores such as
            iron and coal.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>How to Access:</strong> Players start the game in this
            world.

        <div class="pic topic2">
          <img src="./pic/pic5.jpg" alt="The Nether" />
        </div>
        <div class="content topic22"></div>
        <p>
          Just as in the example you mentioned, the Nether is a hell-like
          dimension with a landscape composed mainly of Netherrack, lava, and
          unique structures. The atmosphere in the Nether is always gloomy with
          a distinctive red color.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Main Characteristics:</strong> There is no day/night cycle;
            compasses and clocks do not work. Water evaporates instantly. It is
            home to specific creatures like Ghasts, Piglins, and Nether
            Fortresses.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Resources:</strong> The Nether is the source of rare
            materials that cannot be found in the Overworld, such as Soul Sand,
            Nether Quartz, and gold blocks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>How to Access:</strong> The player must build a Nether
            Portal by arranging Obsidian blocks into a rectangular frame
            (minimum 4x5 blocks) and activate it with a Flint and Steel.
          </li>
        </ul>

            The End is a dark and empty dimension, consisting of a main island
            and countless smaller islands floating in a void. It is considered
            the final dimension in the progression of Minecraft.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Main Characteristics:</strong> This is the home of
              Endermen and the final boss of the game, the Ender Dragon. After
              defeating the Ender Dragon, players can explore the outer islands
              to find End Cities and End Ships.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Resources:</strong> The End is the only place to collect
              End Stone, Chorus Plants, and the most valuable item, the Elytra
              (gliding wings).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>How to Access:</strong> The player must find a Stronghold
              located deep underground in the Overworld. Inside the stronghold,
              there will be an End Portal. To activate the portal, the player
              needs to place 12 Eyes of Ender into the slots on the portal
              frame.
